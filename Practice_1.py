#Take name, age → print age after 10 years
#2️⃣ Take two numbers → print sum, difference, product
#3️⃣ Take price & quantity → calculate bill
#4️⃣ Print type of each variable using type()

name = "Armor"
age= 22
print(f"Hello my name is Siddhant Aka {name} online and my age is {age} years old. ")
print(f"My Age after 10 years old will be {age+10}years old.")

#2️⃣ Take two numbers → print sum, difference, product

num1=10
num2 = 20
sum1 =num1 + num2
diff = num1-num2
multiply = num1 * num2
print(f"The sum of {num1 and num2 }is {sum1}")
print(f"The difference of {num1 and num2 }is {diff}")
print(f" The product of {num1 and num2 } is {multiply}")

#3️⃣ Take price & quantity → calculate bill

price = 200
quantity = 3

bill = price * quantity
print(f"The total bill is {bill}")

#4️⃣ Print type of each variable using type()

float_num  = 22.3
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(price))
print(type(float_num))

print("Done with the tasks , Thank you!")
